# Purpose
This template is suited for typesetting beautiful mathematics notes, geared towards USYD students. It takes some elements of Jack Naylor's USYD template and adds colourful theorem, definition, remark, corollary and fact boxes, while also allowing for colour customisation of the example and proof environments. Edit the preamble.sty file to change colours of things.

# Jack Naylor's documentation
# USYD Report Template
Custom USYD LaTeX template for reports/assignments.

This comes with a preamble file pre-loaded with many common packages, a custom title page and a document pre-set out.

Change authors, titles, subjects etc. with all the hard yards of finding a decent looking package already done!
